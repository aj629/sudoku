# sudoku

Valid.py checks if your board is valid and asks if you want to solve your board
The sudoku solver uses the backtracking algorithm to solve a board.

This file can be used to verify any size board (EX: nontraditional 6x6 cubed with digits 1-36 sudoku boards)

#### Note: 
- The solver which uses back tracking algorithm is no optimal for anything other
  than the traditional 1-9 sudoku boards

- In the test_cases folder are some sudoku examples that were used to test the algorithm out.

- Based on a Tech_With_Tim tutorial but was expanded to any board size and also added verification of board and
  interactive terminal component.
